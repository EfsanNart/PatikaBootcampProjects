# FinalProject - Technology Store Product Management

## Description
This project is designed to record Phone and Computer products in a technology store. It is developed using the C# programming language and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.

## OOP Concepts Used
- **Inheritance**: The `BaseMachine` class is inherited by the `Phone` and `Computer` classes.
- **Encapsulation**: The `UsbGirisSayisi` property restricts input to specific values (2 or 4), assigning -1 otherwise.
- **Polymorphism**: The `BilgileriYazdir()` method is defined in the `BaseMachine` class and overridden in derived classes for customization.
- **Abstraction**: The `BaseMachine` class includes an abstract method `UrunAdiGetir()`, implemented separately in subclasses.
